## About

This project uses data from past IPL seasons to train a predictive model that estimates the probability of a team winning given information such as batting team, bowling team, city, overs completed, wickets lost, target, etc. The model is deployed as a Python application (e.g. via Streamlit or a notebook) for users to interactively predict match outcomes.

## Features

- Predict win probability of the batting team  
- Support for match-level features (team names, venue, etc.)  
- Uses historical IPL data from `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv`  
- Model saved in file `pipe.pkl`  
- Interactive interface (if using Streamlit or similar)

## Dataset

- **matches.csv** ‚Äî contains summary of each match (team names, result, etc.)  
- **deliveries.csv** ‚Äî ball-by-ball data, used for detailed features (runs, extras, etc.)  

Make sure both files are present in the repository.
